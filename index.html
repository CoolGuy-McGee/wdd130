                <p>My name is Dalton Broderson. I am taking a Programming Building Blocks class that is teaching how to code. It is cool that I will get to learn html in this class plus phython in my other class. I enjoy learning about programming, through all of its ups and downs. I like to problem solve and programming scripts, webpages, etc. helps me to do that. I like being able to take my knowledge and create something that many people don't know how to.</p>
